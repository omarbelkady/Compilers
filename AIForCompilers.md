# AI-Driven Compiler Optimizations

## Theory
**AI/ML techniques** automate and enhance compiler tasks:
1. **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Train models to select optimal optimizations (e.g., loop unrolling).
2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Model code as graphs for pattern recognition.
3. **Auto-Tuning**: Search optimization sequences for target hardware.

## Example: RL for Loop Unrolling
```python
# RL agent action space: unroll factors [2, 4, 8]
reward = speedup / code_size
agent.learn(program, reward)
```
